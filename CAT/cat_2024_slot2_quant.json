If $y<0$, $|y|=-y$, so the second eq is $x-2y=20$. Solving gives $x=10, y=-5$. Then $x-y=15$. If $y \\ge 0$, the second eq is $x=20$. Then $2(20)+y=15$ gives $y=-25$, a contradiction.

We can write this as $75a + 75v + 60v + 45s = 300$, so $75(a+v) + 15v + 45(v+s) - 45v = 300$. This doesn't simplify well. Try: $75a + 135v + 45s = 75(a+v) + 60v + 45s = 75(2) + 60v + 45s = 150 + 60v + 45s = 300$. $60v+45s = 150 \\implies 4v+3s=10$. With $v+s=3$, we get $v=1, s=2$. Then $a=1$.

The given condition is $\\frac{\\alpha^2+\\beta^2}{(\\alpha\\beta)^2}=15 \\implies \\frac{(\\alpha+\\beta)^2-2\\alpha\\beta}{(\\alpha\\beta)^2}=15$.

Substituting the values: $((-\\lambda/3)((-\\lambda/3)^2-3(-1/3)))^2 = ((-1)(1+1))^2 = 4$ for $\\lambda=3$. The value will be the same for $\\lambda=-3$.",

    "explanation": "Let distance be D and scheduled time T. From day 1, $D/60 = T+3.5$. On day 2, it travels $2D/3$ in $T/3$ time, so speed is $(2D/3)/(T/3) = 2D/T$. The remaining $D/3$ is travelled at 40 km/h, taking time $(D/3)/40 = D/120$. Total time on day 2 is $T/3 + D/120 = T$. So $D/120 = 2T/3 \\implies D = 80T$. Substitute this into the first equation: $80T/60 = T+3.5 \\implies 4T/3 = T+3.5 \\implies T/3=3.5 \\implies T=10.5$ hours. Bus starts at 9 am. Scheduled arrival time is 9 am + 10.5 hours = 7:30 pm.",

Next, 15L acid is added. Total acid is A+15, total solution is A+W+2+15=A+W+17. Acid concentration is $(A+15)/(A+W+17)=0.8$.

This simplifies to $(2x-y)^2 + 3(y-1)^2 = 0$. Since squares of real numbers are non-negative, for the sum to be zero, each term must be zero. So, $y-1=0 \\implies y=1$.
