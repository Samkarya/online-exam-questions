However, older Nigerian texts might say 20m. Given '30m' encompasses the acceleration area often taught, 30m is currently correct, though 20m is the classic answer. Let's select '30m' as the standard answer or provide the most distinct options. In local exams, 20m was the strict exchange zone. Since 2018 rules, it's 30m. I will use 20m if 30m is not an option or clarify. Actually, I will set the answer to 20m to align with many textbooks if 30m isn't updated, but let's stick to valid facts.
