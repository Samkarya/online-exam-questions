## Unlock the Power of AI for Your Exam Prep

We have added exciting new features to Examify to help you prepare for exams using the power of Artificial Intelligence. While we are constantly working to add official exam papers, finding and organizing them can be challenging as many are not publicly available.

To bridge this gap, we've introduced **AI-generated exam papers**. These live in a dedicated AI section, clearly separated from official exams, giving you unlimited practice material.

## Empowering You to Create Your Own Exams

Our goal has always been to empower learners to take control of their preparation. With the arrival of powerful, free, and multimodal AI models, we can now give you the ultimate tool to create your own exam papers.

We realized that static, pre-generated AI papers aren't personalized enough. True learning happens when *you* choose the material that matters to you.

**We want to empower you to create your own exam papers using AI.**

To make this easy, we have provided a specialized **Prompt** that you can use with any LLM (Large Language Model) to generate compatible exam JSONs.

> **Where to find the prompt:**
> Go to the `/exam-not-found` page by clicking **"Can't find exam"** in the header or footer of the website.

## Your New Superpower: Choose Your Source Material

This feature gives you the superpower to turn *anything* into an exam paper. You are no longer limited to textbooks. You can create exams from:

*   **Multimedia:** YouTube videos, Podcasts, Audio lectures.
*   **Documents:** PDFs, Research papers, Journals.
*   **Web Content:** Articles, News reports, Blog posts.
*   **Physical Media:** Photos of book pages or handwritten notes.

Simply feed the content to a state-of-the-art model like **ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini**, along with our prompt, and watch it generate a structured exam for you.

## How It Works: A Real-World Example

Imagine you are studying a complex topic on YouTube.

1.  **Take the video transcript** (or the video link if your AI model supports it).
2.  **Paste it into ChatGPT**, your favorite LLM, or any other multimodal AI tool.
3.  **Add the Examify Prompt.**
4.  **Get a JSON output.**
5.  **Upload to Examify.**

To see a live example of what's possible, try our **AI-generated IELTS Listening exam** on the platform. You will see exactly what we mean by using any source material to create a personalized exam paper.
