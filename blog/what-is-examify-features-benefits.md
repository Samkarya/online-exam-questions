## What is Examify?
Examify is more than just a collection of questions; it's a dedicated, **open-source** practice platform built to help students prepare effectively for high-stakes exams like NIMCET and CUET MCA. We believe that success hinges not only on subject knowledge but also on familiarity with the exam interface, smart time management, and the crucial capability to analyze and learn from your performance.

Our core mission is to provide an accessible, high-quality, and transparent tool that simulates the real exam experience and empowers you with actionable insights for improvement.

## Key Features That Power Your Preparation

Examify packs a suite of features specifically designed for rigorous and flexible exam preparation:

### 1. Realistic Exam Simulation Environment
Get accustomed to the actual test conditions *before* exam day:
*   **Timed Sessions:** Practice answering questions under time constraints to improve speed and accuracy. Choose a set duration or practice self-paced.
*   **Interactive Question Palette:** Easily navigate between questions. See at-a-glance which questions are answered, unanswered, or marked for review. Jump directly to any question.
*   **Standard Exam Controls:** Utilize familiar options like "Mark for Review," "Next," "Previous," and "Clear Response," mirroring interfaces used in many official online exams.

### 2. Flexible Question Sources
Practice with the material that matters most to *you*:
*   **Official Mock Tests:** Access official past papers for exams like NIMCET, sourced transparently from our public [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Samkarya/online-exam-questions). Understand real exam patterns and difficulty levels.
*   **Upload or Paste Your Own (Custom JSON):** Have question sets from coaching classes, specific topics you need extra practice on, or AI-generated quizzes? Easily upload them as a simple JSON file or paste the JSON code directly. We provide a [clear format example](/select-exam#json-format-example) to guide you.

### 3. In-Depth Performance Analysis
Learning from your practice is crucial:
*   **Instant Results:** Immediately after submitting, see your score, maximum possible marks, and a breakdown of correct, incorrect, and unattempted questions, often visualized with charts.
*   **Detailed Answer Review:** Go back through the exam question by question. Compare your chosen answer with the correct one and review any available explanations.
*   **Attempt History:** Your attempts are saved locally in your browser, allowing you to track your progress without needing a cloud account.

### 4. Privacy-First & Offline Capable
We respect your data and your need for focus:
*   **Local Storage:** Examify operates on a "Local First" principle. Your exam attempts and history are stored right in your browser. We don't sell your data or track your every move.
*   **Offline Mode:** Once the application and your chosen test are loaded, you can go completely offline. This ensures a distraction-free environment and means you can practice even with spotty internet connections.

### 5. Open Source & Community Driven
Examify is built by the community, for the community.
*   **Transparent Code:** Our entire codebase is open source. You can see exactly how the platform works.
*   **Community Content:** The question bank is also open. Anyone can contribute new tests or fix errors in existing ones via GitHub.
