title: "Practice Infinite MCQs from Your Board Exam"
---
fed up of sign ups and logins, pay to use to access practice materials?

use ai chatbots like perplixity, claude, gemini, chatgpt, nootbookllm etc that u already have access to generate mcqs for your board exam, u can use these chatbots to practice based on your needs and keep on practicing until you get a good score.  

u will be thinking but these modal only generate text or markdown responses how can we practice mcqs from it?

u can use Examify to practice mcqs from the chatbot responses. without signup, login or paying single rupee.

how??

use our this [prompt placeholder](/prompt-placeholder) in any ai chatbot with material u want to practice from it can be any thing that your chatbot can analyze and generate mcqs for u. and copy the response and paste it in Examify and start practicing.

see how u performed, how much time u spent per question, how many question u answered and keep doing it until u get satisfied with your performance.
