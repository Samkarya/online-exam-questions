## Step 1: Choosing Your Practice Mode
Navigate to the ["Select Exam"](https://examify.web.app/select-exam) page. This is your central hub for starting any practice.

You have two main options for content:

1.  **Official Mock Tests:**
    *   Choose a category (e.g., "NIMCET").
    *   Select the year/specific test instance.
    *   These use question sets from our public [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Samkarya/online-exam-questions).

2.  **Custom Test (Upload or Paste):**
    *   **Upload:** Click "Choose JSON File" and select a `.json` file from your device. Ensure it follows the [required format](/select-exam#json-format-example) (an example is shown on the page).
    *   **Paste:** Click "Paste JSON Code," paste your JSON array into the text area, and click "Validate Pasted JSON."
    *   *(Remember: You are responsible for the content and rights for custom tests - [Terms of Service](/terms-of-service)).*

## Step 2: Configuring Your Session
Once a valid source is selected, the "Start Individual Session" button will become active. Click it to move to session configuration.

*   **Time Limit:** Enter desired duration in minutes (leave 0 or blank for untimed practice).
*   **Marks per Correct Answer:** Set the points awarded for each right answer.
*   **Negative Marking:** Enable and specify deduction if desired (e.g., 0.25 for 1/4th negative marking).
*   **(Optional) Track Question Time:** Enable this to record how long you spend on each question—invaluable for analyzing your pacing later.

Click "Start Exam" to begin.

## Step 3: Taking the Exam – The Interface
The exam interface is designed to mimic real online exams:

*   **Main Area:** Displays the current question and options. Select your answer.
*   **Timer:** Shows remaining/elapsed time.
*   **Navigation Palette:** A color-coded grid of question numbers (answered, unanswered, marked, not visited). Click to jump to any question.
*   **Exam Controls:**
    *   `Previous` / `Next`: Navigate sequentially.
    *   `Clear Response`: Remove your selected answer.
    *   `Mark for Review`: Flag a question to revisit later.
    *   `Save & Next`: Saves your answer and moves to the next question.

## Step 4: Submitting Your Exam
When you are finished, click "Submit Exam" (usually near the palette). Confirm your submission in the prompt that summarizes your attempt (how many answered, marked, etc.).

## Step 5: Understanding Your Results
You'll be immediately redirected to the Results page:

*   **Score Card:** Your overall score, percentage, and accuracy.
*   **Breakdown:** Counts of Correct, Incorrect, and Unattempted questions.
*   **Visuals:** Charts to help you visualize your performance distribution.

## Step 6: Reviewing Your Answers (Key Learning Step!)
From the Results page, click "Review Answers." This is where the real learning happens.

*   **Navigate:** Go through the questions using "Previous"/"Next" or the Review Palette.
*   **Compare:** See the question, options, your chosen answer (if any), and the correct answer highlighted.
*   **Explanations:** Read official explanations (if available in the question set).
*   **Filter:** Use the filter options to view only "Incorrect" or "Unattempted" questions for a focused review session.

## Step 7: Checking Your History
Visit your ["Profile"](/profile) to:
*   View all saved exam attempts.
*   See your performance trends over time.
*   Revisit results pages for past exams.
*   Manage (delete) old attempts to keep your history clean.

**Note:** Your history is stored locally in your browser. Clearing your browser cache may remove this history, so be mindful!

## Tips for Effective Practice
*   **Simulate Real Conditions:** Use the timer and minimize distractions.
*   **Strategic Marking:** Use "Mark for Review" effectively to skip tough questions and return later.
*   **Thorough Review:** Focus on *why* you made mistakes.
*   **Targeted Practice:** Leverage custom tests (JSON uploads) to drill on specific weak areas.

You're now equipped to make the most of all Examify features! Happy practicing, and good luck with your exams!
