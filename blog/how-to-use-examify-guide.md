# How to Use Examify: A Step-by-Step Guide

Ready to dive into focused exam practice with Examify ([https://examify.web.app/](https://examify.web.app/))? This guide will walk you through the key steps, from selecting your test to understanding your results.

## Step 1: Accessing Examify (Account Optional but Recommended)

You can explore available exams without an account. However, to save your attempt history and track progress over time, you'll need to log in using your **MyServices Portal** account.

*   **If you have an account:** Click the "Login" button.
*   **If you don't:** You can [register](https://bcaexamprep.web.app/register) on the main MyServices Portal first.

Logging in ensures your practice efforts are recorded (as detailed in our [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy)).

## Step 2: Selecting Your Practice Exam

Navigate to the ["Select Exam"](https://examify.web.app/select-exam) page. You have two main options:

1.  **Official Mock Tests:**
    *   Choose a category (e.g., "NIMCET").
    *   Select the specific year or test instance you want to attempt.
    *   These tests use question sets sourced from our public [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Samkarya/online-exam-questions).

2.  **Custom Test (Upload or Paste):**
    *   **Upload:** Click "Choose JSON File" and select a `.json` file from your device that follows the required format (an example is shown on the page).
    *   **Paste:** Click "Paste JSON Code Instead," paste your JSON array into the text area, and click "Validate Pasted JSON."
    *   *Remember:* You are responsible for the content and rights associated with custom tests you use ([Terms of Service](/terms-of-service)).

## Step 3: Configuring Your Practice Session

Once you've selected an exam source (official or custom), you'll likely be prompted to configure the session settings:

*   **Time Limit:** Enter the desired duration in minutes (e.g., 120). Leave empty or enter 0 for an untimed session.
*   **Marks per Correct Answer:** Set the points awarded for each correct answer.
*   **Negative Marking:** Enable or disable negative marking. If enabled, specify the marks deducted per incorrect answer.
*   **(Optional) Track Question Time:** Enable this if you want to see how long you spent on each question during review (may slightly increase data stored).

Click "Start Exam" when ready.

## Step 4: Taking the Exam – The Interface

You'll now be in the simulation environment:

*   **Main Area:** Displays the current question and options. Select your answer by clicking the radio button or the option label.
*   **Timer:** Shows remaining time (if timed) or elapsed time. It might change color when time is low!
*   **Navigation Palette:** A grid of question numbers. Colors indicate status (e.g., green for answered, red for unanswered, blue for marked, gray for not visited). Click any number to jump directly to that question.
*   **Exam Controls:**
    *   `Previous` / `Next`: Move sequentially through questions.
    *   `Clear Response`: Unselect your current answer for the question.
    *   `Mark for Review` / `Unmark`: Toggle a flag on the question (visible on the palette) to remind yourself to revisit it. You can mark answered or unanswered questions.
    *   `Save & Next`: Saves the current state implicitly (by selecting an option) and moves to the next question.

## Step 5: Submitting Your Exam

When you're finished or time runs out, click the "Submit Exam" button (usually near the palette). You'll likely see a confirmation prompt summarizing your attempt (answered, unanswered, marked counts). Confirm to end the exam and calculate your results.

## Step 6: Understanding Your Results

You'll be automatically redirected to the Results page for your attempt. Here you'll find:

*   Your overall score and percentage.
*   A breakdown of correct, incorrect, and unattempted questions.
*   A visual pie chart of the breakdown.
*   Details like time taken and the settings you used.

## Step 7: Reviewing Your Answers (Key Learning Step!)

From the Results page, click the "Review Answers" button (Note: currently available for official/non-custom tests). This takes you to the Review page:

*   Navigate using "Previous"/"Next" or the Review Palette.
*   See the question, all options, the correct answer highlighted, and your chosen answer indicated (often with a checkmark if correct, or a cross/strikethrough if incorrect).
*   Read any available explanations for the question.
*   Filter the questions (e.g., show only incorrect or unattempted) for focused review.

## Step 8: Checking Your Attempt History

Visit your ["Profile"](/profile) page (requires login) at any time to see a list of all your saved attempts. You can revisit results pages from here or delete old attempts if needed.

## Tips for Effective Practice

*   **Simulate Real Conditions:** Use the timer, avoid distractions, and try to complete sections within realistic timeframes.
*   **Use "Mark for Review":** Practice skipping difficult questions and returning later.
*   **Review Thoroughly:** Don't just look at the score. Understand *why* you made mistakes using the Review feature.
*   **Leverage Custom Tests:** Use the upload/paste feature for targeted practice on weak areas or specific topics.

You're now ready to make the most of Examify! Happy practicing!
