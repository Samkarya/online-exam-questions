At Examify ([https://examify.web.app/](https://examify.web.app/)), we believe that the best competition is with yourself. To help you build discipline and focus, we've introduced **Self-Proctoring Tools (Sandbox Mode)**.

This post explains how these tools work and how they can help you simulate a strict exam environment right from your home.

## Why Self-Proctoring?

Distractions are the enemy of effective practice. When you're taking a mock test at home, it's easy to check a notification, quickly Google an answer, or lose track of time.

Examify's **Sandbox Mode** is designed to:
*   **Build Discipline:** Train your brain to stay focused for the entire duration of the exam.
*   **Simulate Pressure:** Mimic the strict conditions of a real exam center.
*   **Track Focus:** Provide you with a report of your "Focus Loss" events so you can improve over time.

## How it Works: The Focus Shield

When you start an exam in **Sandbox Mode**, Examify activates the **Focus Shield**.

### 1. Focus Tracking (Tab/Window Switch Detection)
*   **What it does:** Detects if you switch to another tab or minimize the exam window.
*   **Feedback:** A small "Monitoring Active" (<FaEye />) icon appears. If you leave the window, the app logs the event.
*   **The Report:** At the end of the exam, your result card will show a "Focus Score" or a list of times you lost focus.

### 2. Clipboard Lockdown
*   **What it does:** Prevents copying question text or pasting into the exam.
*   **Why:** Real exams don't allow copy-paste. This feature ensures you are reading and processing the question yourself, not relying on external tools.

### 3. Restricted Key Logging
*   **What it does:** Logs attempts to use shortcuts like `PrintScreen` or `Ctrl+C`.
*   **Goal:** To discourage the habit of capturing questions for later instead of solving them now.

## Privacy First: Your Data Stays Local

Unlike other proctoring solutions that record video or send data to a cloud server, Examify's Integrity Tools are **Client-Side Only**.
*   **No Webcams:** We do not access your camera or microphone.
*   **Local Storage:** Your focus logs and exam results are stored in your browser's Local Storage.
*   **You are in Control:** These tools are for *your* benefit, to help you improve.

## Conclusion

Mastering the subject is only half the battle. Mastering your attention is the other half. Use Examify's Self-Proctoring tools to train your mind for the rigors of exam day.
