        "difficulty": "Medium",
        "explanation": "When recording a measurement, you estimate one digit beyond the smallest marking. Since the buret is marked every $0.1\\ \\text{mL}$, the reading should be estimated to the hundredths place ($0.01\\ \\text{mL}$), making **$20.15\\ \\text{mL}$** the correct format.",
