Which of the following is an accurate principle to include in a response to this concern?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Toned muscles are necessary for gains in size and strength, so only females who begin training with well-defined muscles will develop larger ones.",
      "b": "Although training improves the weight-bearing capacity of bones and joints, it has little effect on the muscular strength of females.",
      "c": "Training promotes considerable gains in strength but only slight increases in muscle bulk because of females' low testosterone levels.",
      "d": "Only lower body training causes females to gain significant muscle bulk because their leg strength-to-weight ratios are higher than male ratios."
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Significant muscle hypertrophy (growth in bulk) is largely dependent on the hormone testosterone. Because females have much lower levels of testosterone than males, strength training leads to significant gains in strength and tone without large increases in muscle size.",
