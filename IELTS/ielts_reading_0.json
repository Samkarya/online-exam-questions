        "question_text": "Read the following passage and answer Questions 1–13.\n\n**The Evolution of Urban Planning**\n\nFrom the earliest grid systems of the Indus Valley Civilization to the sprawling smart cities of the 21st century, urban planning has reflected humanity’s attempt to impose order on chaos. The ruins of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, dating back to 2600 BCE, reveal a surprising level of sophistication. These cities were laid out on a north-south grid, featuring advanced drainage systems and distinct residential and industrial zones. This suggests that early urbanisation was not organic but deliberate, driven by the need for sanitation and trade efficiency.\n\nIn contrast, the medieval cities of Europe often developed organically around a castle or cathedral, resulting in winding, narrow streets. It was not until the Renaissance that aesthetic considerations, such as symmetry and perspective, began to influence European city design. However, the true turning point was the Industrial Revolution. The rapid influx of workers into cities like London and Manchester created overcrowding and disease, forcing governments to rethink urban design purely for public health. This era gave birth to the 'Garden City' movement initiated by Ebenezer Howard in 1898, which proposed self-contained communities surrounded by \"greenbelts\"—a concept still relevant today.\n\nModern urban planning faces different challenges: sustainability and data. The concept of the 'Smart City' integrates technology to manage traffic, waste, and energy consumption. Yet, critics argue that while technological efficiency is desirable, it risks creating sterile environments that lack the cultural vibrancy of organically developed neighbourhoods. The challenge for future planners is to balance the efficiency of the grid with the soul of the community.\n\n---\n\n**Question 1:**\nAccording to the passage, what does the layout of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa suggest about early urbanisation?",

        "question_text": "Read the following passage and answer Questions 14–26.\n\n**Bioluminescence: Nature’s Living Light**\n\nBioluminescence is the production and emission of light by a living organism. It is a form of chemiluminescence, where energy is released from a chemical reaction as light. The principal chemical involved in this process is luciferin, which reacts with oxygen in the presence of an enzyme called luciferase. While fireflies are the most famous examples on land, the phenomenon is far more common in the deep ocean, where an estimated 76% of oceanic animals are bioluminescent.\n\nThe evolutionary purposes of this \"living light\" are diverse. For many deep-sea creatures, it is a primary method of communication in the eternal darkness. The anglerfish uses a bioluminescent lure dangling from its forehead to attract unsuspecting prey. Conversely, some species of squid use ‘counter-illumination’ camouflage; they emit light from their undersides to match the brightness of the ocean surface above, effectively hiding their silhouette from predators swimming below. Others, like certain species of shrimp, vomit a cloud of glowing bioluminescent fluid to startle predators, buying time to escape—a tactic analogous to a squid’s ink cloud.\n\nScientifically, bioluminescence has revolutionized medical research. The Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), originally isolated from the crystal jelly (*Aequorea victoria*), allows researchers to \"tag\" and track specific proteins within living cells. This has provided unprecedented insights into how cancer spreads and how nerve cells develop. Beyond medicine, bio-engineers are currently exploring the possibility of splicing bioluminescent genes into trees to create self-illuminating streetlights, potentially reducing global electricity consumption.\n\n---\n\n**Question 14:**\nAccording to the passage, which chemical is principally responsible for the production of light in bioluminescence?",

        "question_text": "Read the following passage and answer Questions 27–40.\n\n**The Psychology of Decision Fatigue**\n\nWe like to believe that our decisions are based on logic, rationality, and character. However, a growing body of psychological research suggests that the quality of our decisions erodes as the day wears on—a phenomenon known as 'decision fatigue'. Unlike physical fatigue, where you consciously feel tired, decision fatigue operates on a subconscious level. The more choices you make throughout the day, the harder each subsequent choice becomes for your brain.\n\nRoy Baumeister, a social psychologist, posits that willpower is like a muscle that can be depleted. In a famous study analysing over 1,100 court rulings, researchers found that prisoners were significantly more likely to be granted parole early in the morning. As the day progressed, the likelihood of a favourable ruling dropped to nearly zero, only to spike back up to 65% immediately after the judge took a lunch break. The tired brain, seeking to conserve energy, defaults to the safest, easiest option: the status quo (denying parole).\n\nThis phenomenon has significant implications for consumer behaviour and management. Supermarkets place candy at checkout lanes because, by the end of a shopping trip, shoppers’ willpower is depleted, making them more susceptible to impulse buys. Similarly, successful individuals like Steve Jobs or Barack Obama famously reduced their daily clothing options to minimise 'decision load' for trivial matters, reserving their mental energy for high-stakes choices. Recognizing decision fatigue is the first step in mitigating its effects, suggesting that critical decisions should invariably be made early in the day or immediately after a period of rest and glucose replenishment.\n\n---\n\n**Question 27:**\nAccording to the passage, what is the fundamental difference between decision fatigue and physical fatigue?",
