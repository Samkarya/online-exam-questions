    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Dispersion occurs because the refractive index of a material varies with the wavelength of light. In a prism, shorter wavelengths (blue/violet) are refracted more than longer wavelengths (red) due to this variation. According to Snell's Law ($n_1\\sin\\theta_1 = n_2\\sin\\theta_2$), the light bends at different angles, causing separation into a spectrum.
