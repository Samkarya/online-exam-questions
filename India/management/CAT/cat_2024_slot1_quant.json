    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Let the number of apples be $5k$ and mangoes be $2k$. Oranges = $187 - 7k$. After selling, unsold apples are $5k-75$ and unsold oranges are $(187-7k)/2$. Given the ratio: $(5k-75) / ((187-7k)/2) = 3/2$. Solving this gives $2(5k-75) = 3(187-7k)/2 \\Rightarrow 20k-300 = 561-21k \\Rightarrow 41k = 861 \\Rightarrow k=21$. Apples=105, Mangoes=42, Oranges=40. Unsold fruits = $(105-75) + (42-26) + (40/2) = 30+16+20=66$.",

    "explanation": "We need to find $\\sqrt{29 - 12\\sqrt{5}}$. We can write this as $\\sqrt{29 - 2\\sqrt{180}}$. We look for two numbers whose sum is 29 and product is 180. The numbers are 20 and 9. So, the square root is $\\sqrt{20} - \\sqrt{9} = 2\\sqrt{5} - 3$. To match the form $a+b\\sqrt{n}$, we can write this as $-3 + 2\\sqrt{5}$. This gives $a=-3, b=2, n=5$. Then $a+b+n = 4$. Alternatively, we can write $2\\sqrt{5}$ as $\\sqrt{20}$. This gives $-3+\\sqrt{20}$, so $a=-3, b=1, n=20$. Then $a+b+n = -3+1+20 = 18$. The maximum value is 18.",

    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Triangle ADE is a right-angled triangle with angle D being $90^{\\circ}$. The sides are AD = 45 cm and DE = CD/2 = 56/2 = 28 cm. The hypotenuse is $AE = \\sqrt{45^2 + 28^2} = \\sqrt{2025+784} = \\sqrt{2809} = 53$ cm. The inradius ${r}$ of a right-angled triangle is given by $r = (a+b-c)/2$, where $a, b$ are the legs and ${c}$ is the hypotenuse. So, $r = (45+28-53)/2 = 20/2 = 10$ cm.",

    "question_text": "If the equations $x^2+m x+9=0, x^2+n x+17=0$ and $x^2+(m+n) x+35=0$ have a common negative root, then the value of $(2 m+3 n)$ is",

    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Let the common root be $\\alpha$. Adding the first two equations gives $2\\alpha^2 + (m+n)\\alpha + 26=0$. Also from the third equation we have $\\alpha^2+(m+n)\\alpha+35=0$. Subtracting this from the doubled third equation gives $(2\\alpha^2+2(m+n)\\alpha+70) - (2\\alpha^2+(m+n)\\alpha+26) = 0$, leading to $(m+n)\\alpha = -44$. Substituting this into the third eq: $\\alpha^2 - 44 + 35 = 0 \\implies \\alpha^2=9$. Since the root is negative, $\\alpha=-3$. Plugging $\\alpha=-3$ into the first eq gives $m=6$. Plugging into the second eq gives $n=26/3$. So $2m+3n = 2(6)+3(26/3)=12+26=38$.",

    "explanation": "Let original CP = C. Then original SP = 1.4C. New CP = 0.6C. New SP = SP-5 = 1.4C-5. The new profit is 50%, so New SP = 1.5 * (New CP). This gives $1.4C-5 = 1.5(0.6C) = 0.9C$. Solving for C: $0.5C=5 \\implies C=10$. The original selling price is $1.4C = 1.4(10)=14$.",

    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Using the change of base formula, $\\log_{100} x = (\\log_{10} x)/2$ and $\\log_{1000} x = (\\log_{10} x)/3$. The equation becomes $4\\log_{10} x + 4(\\frac{\\log_{10} x}{2}) + 8(\\frac{\\log_{10} x}{3}) = 13$. Let $L=\\log_{10}x$. Then $4L+2L+(8/3)L=13 \\Rightarrow 6L+(8/3)L = 13 \\Rightarrow (26/3)L=13 \\Rightarrow L=1.5$. So $x=10^{1.5} = 10\\sqrt{10} = \\sqrt{1000}$. Since $31^2 = 961$ and $32^2 = 1024$, the value of ${x}$ is between 31 and 32. The greatest integer not exceeding ${x}$ is 31.",
