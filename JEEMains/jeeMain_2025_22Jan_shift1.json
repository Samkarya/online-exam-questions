Assuming the standard form related to $f(x)=e^{4ax}$, the integral of $f(ax) = e^{4a^2x}$ from 0 to 2 gives $\\frac{1}{4a^2}(e^{8a^2}-1)$. If $a=1/2$, this gives $e^2-1$. Alternative interpretation based on the equation as written might yield different results. Let's assume the likely intended form leading to option 'a'. Functional equation $f(x+y)=f(x)f(y)$ with $f(0)=1$ implies $f(x) = e^{kx}$. $f'(x)=ke^{kx}$, $f'(0)=k=4a$. So $f(x)=e^{4ax}$. $f''(x)=16a^2e^{4ax}$. Substituting into $f''(x)-3af'(x)-f(x)=0$: $16a^2e^{4ax} - 3a(4ae^{4ax}) - e^{4ax} = 0 \implies (16a^2 - 12a^2 - 1)e^{4ax} = 0 \implies 4a^2 - 1 = 0 \implies a=1/2$ (since a>0).

Let $S_n = \frac{n}{6}(2n-1)(2n+1)(2n+3)(2n+5)$. $T_n = S_n - S_{n-1}$. This calculation is tedious. Observe the structure resembles products. Maybe $T_r$ is simpler. Let's test simple cases. $S_1=T_1 = \frac{1}{6}(1)(3)(5)(7)=35/2$? Let's rethink the given $S_n$. It seems extremely large for typical series. The summation appears incorrect in the question OCR. Assuming $T_r = r(r+1)...$ structure. Another possibility is $T_r = (2r-1)(2r+1)(2r+3)(2r+5)$. Let $S_n = \sum_{r=1}^n T_r$. Then $\lim \sum \frac{1}{T_r}$ might be telescopic. If $T_r = (2r-1)(2r+1)(2r+3)(2r+5)$, then $\frac{1}{T_r} = \frac{1}{(2r-1)(2r+1)(2r+3)(2r+5)}$. Use partial fractions: $\frac{1}{T_r} = \frac{1}{8} \left( \frac{1}{(2r-1)(2r+1)(2r+3)} - \frac{1}{(2r+1)(2r+3)(2r+5)} \right)$. Let $V_r = \frac{1}{(2r-1)(2r+1)(2r+3)}$. Then the sum is $\frac{1}{8} \sum (V_r - V_{r+1})$. The limit sum is $\frac{1}{8}(V_1 - \lim V_{n+1}) = \frac{1}{8}(V_1 - 0) = \frac{1}{8} \frac{1}{(1)(3)(5)} = \frac{1}{120}$. This doesn't match options. Let's check the answer key: Q15 is (2) i.e., 3/5. There might be a typo in the question statement or the provided summation formula. Retrying with the provided $S_n$. It's unlikely the sum limit would be needed if $S_n$ is given. Perhaps the question meant: If $T_r = (2r-1)(2r+1)(2r+3)(2r+5)$, then calculate limit sum. The expression $\frac{n}{6}$ might be a typo for $\frac{1}{6}$ or similar. Without a clear $T_r$, using the answer (b) $\frac{3}{5}$ doesn't help derive the correct $T_r$ easily."

By energy conservation between A and D: $KE_A + PE_A = KE_D + PE_D \implies \frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 + 0 = \frac{1}{2}mv_D^2 + mgl(1 - \\cos\\theta)$. Points B and C are at the same height, corresponding to 60 degrees from the vertical (A). Height $h_B = h_C = l(1-\\cos 60^\circ) = l/2$. By energy conservation A to B: $\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 = \frac{1}{2}mv_B^2 + mgh_B = \frac{1}{2}mv_B^2 + mgl/2$. By energy conservation A to C: $\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 = \frac{1}{2}mv_C^2 + mgh_C = \frac{1}{2}mv_C^2 + mgl/2$. Thus $KE_B = \frac{1}{2}mv_B^2 = \frac{1}{2}mv_C^2 = KE_C$. The ratio $KE_B / KE_C = 1$. However, the options and answer key (Q31 -> 2) suggest there might be a misunderstanding or error in the problem statement or diagram interpretation. If B is at 60 deg and C is at 120 deg from A (horizontal level), heights are $h_B=l/2$, $h_C=l$. Then $KE_B = KE_A - mgl/2$, $KE_C = KE_A - mgl$. Ratio depends on $KE_A$. Let's assume C is at 90 deg from vertical. $h_C = l$. $KE_C = KE_A-mgl$. Ratio $KE_B/KE_C = (KE_A - mgl/2) / (KE_A - mgl)$. This still depends on $v_0$. Let's use the slack condition. Often slackness occurs at $\theta > 90^\circ$. If slackness occurs *exactly* horizontally (at 90 deg), $v_D=0$. $KE_A = mgl$. Then $KE_B = mgl - mgl/2 = mgl/2$. $KE_C = mgl-mgl = 0$. Ratio undefined. If slackness occurs at top, $v_D^2=gl$. $KE_A = \frac{1}{2}m(5gl) = 2.5 mgl$. $KE_B = 2.5mgl - 0.5mgl = 2mgl$. $KE_C = 2.5mgl - mgl = 1.5mgl$. Ratio $2/1.5 = 4/3$. None match option 2. Let's assume B angle is 60 from vertical downwards, C is 60 from vertical upwards. $h_B = l(1-\cos 60) = l/2$. $h_C = l(1-\cos 120) = l(1 - (-1/2)) = 3l/2$. $KE_B = KE_A - mgl/2$. $KE_C = KE_A - 3mgl/2$. Ratio requires $KE_A$. If slack occurs at D (assume D corresponds to an angle $\theta$), $v_D^2=gl\cos\theta$. $\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2=\frac{1}{2}mv_D^2+mgl(1+\cos\theta)$. Let's re-examine the image. C is 60 degrees *above* horizontal A, B is 60 degrees *below* horizontal A. So height B is $l \sin 60 = l\sqrt{3}/2$. Height C is $l \sin 60 = l\sqrt{3}/2$. They are at same height relative to O horizontal. Relative to A, height of B is $l(1-\cos 60) = l/2$. Height of C is $l(1+\cos 60) = 3l/2$? No, B and C are symmetric wrt vertical. $h_B = l(1-\cos 60) = l/2$. $h_C = l(1-\cos 60)=l/2$. KE ratio is 1. Let's assume B is at 60 deg, C is at 90 deg (horizontal). $h_B = l/2$, $h_C = l$. $KE_B = KE_A - mgl/2$. $KE_C = KE_A - mgl$. Let's assume answer (2) is correct and work backwards. $KE_B / KE_C = 2 \implies KE_A - mgl/2 = 2(KE_A - mgl) \implies KE_A - mgl/2 = 2KE_A - 2mgl \implies KE_A = 1.5 mgl = \frac{3}{2} mgl$. $\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 = \frac{3}{2}mgl \implies v_0^2=3gl$. This means $v_0$ is between $\sqrt{2gl}$ (reach horizontal) and $\sqrt{5gl}$ (complete circle). Where does it slack? At angle $\theta$ where $v^2=gl\cos\theta$. $KE_A = KE_\theta + mgl(1-\cos\theta)$. $1.5mgl = 0.5m(gl\cos\theta) + mgl(1-\cos\theta) \implies 1.5 = 0.5\cos\theta + 1-\cos\theta \implies 0.5 = -0.5\cos\theta \implies \cos\theta = -1$. Slack at the top. If $v_0^2=3gl$, it reaches C (horizontal) with $KE_C=1.5mgl-mgl=0.5mgl$. Reaches B with $KE_B = 1.5mgl-0.5mgl=1mgl$. Ratio $KE_B/KE_C = (1mgl)/(0.5mgl) = 2$. This matches answer (b) if C is assumed to be at the horizontal level (90 degrees from A).",

Wait, 9th harmonic for closed pipe should be $(2 \times 9 - 1) = 17$? Let's assume '9th harmonic' means n=9 index in the sequence of possible frequencies. Closed: $f_1, f_3, f_5, ... f_{2k-1}$ is the kth harmonic. So 9th harmonic has $2k-1=9 \implies k=5$? If n=9 is the multiplier: $f_{9c}=9 v_1 / (4L_c)$. 4th harmonic of open pipe: $f_{4o} = 4 v_2 / (2L_o) = 2 v_2 / L_o$. $9 v_1 / (4 L_c) = 2 v_2 / L_o$. $L_o = (8 L_c / 9) (v_2/v_1) = (8 \times 10 / 9) \times (1/4) = 80 / 36 = 20/9$ cm. Let's reconsider harmonic numbering. Closed: $f_1, 3f_1, 5f_1, ...$. 9th harmonic is $17f_1 = 17 v_1 / (4L_c)$. Open: $f'_1, 2f'_1, 3f'_1, ...$. 4th harmonic is $4f'_1 = 4 v_2 / (2L_o) = 2v_2/L_o$. $17 v_1 / (4L_c) = 2 v_2 / L_o$. $L_o = (8 L_c / 17) (v_2/v_1) = (8 \times 10 / 17) (1/4) = 20/17$ cm. Option (d) is 20/3 cm. Let's check if 9th harmonic *number* is 9. Closed: $f_n = n \frac{v_1}{4 L_c}$, n=1,3,5... Let the frequency be $f_{9c}$. Open: $f_n = n \frac{v_2}{2 L_o}$, n=1,2,3... 4th harmonic is $f_{4o} = 4 \frac{v_2}{2 L_o}$. If 9th harmonic means the 9th possible frequency for closed pipe, it is $n=17$. If it means index 9 in the formula, $n=9$. Let's assume n=9 for closed pipe (only odd n allowed). $f_{9c} = 9 \frac{v_1}{4 L_c}$. $f_{4o} = 4 \frac{v_2}{2 L_o}$. $9 \frac{v_1}{4 (10)} = 4 \frac{v_2}{2 L_o}$. $\frac{9 v_1}{40} = \frac{2 v_2}{L_o}$. $L_o = \frac{80 v_2}{9 v_1} = \frac{80}{9} \frac{1}{4} = \frac{20}{9}$ cm. Still not matching. Let's re-read answer key: 36 -> (4). Option (d) is 20/3. Maybe $\rho_1:\rho_2=16:1$? Then $v_1/v_2 = \sqrt{1/16}=1/4$. $L_o = \frac{80}{9} (\frac{v_2}{v_1}) = \frac{80}{9} (4) = \frac{320}{9}$ cm. No. Let's assume 9th harmonic means frequency is 9 * fundamental for closed pipe: $9 f_{1c} = 9 \frac{v_1}{4L_c}$. 4th harmonic of open pipe $4 f_{1o} = 4 \frac{v_2}{2L_o}$. Then $9 \frac{v_1}{4L_c} = 4 \frac{v_2}{2L_o}$. $L_o = \frac{8 L_c}{9} \frac{v_2}{v_1} = \frac{8 \times 10}{9} \frac{1}{4} = \frac{20}{9}$ cm. The calculation seems consistent. Let's verify option (d) $20/3$ cm. If $L_o=20/3$, then $f_{4o} = 2 v_2 / (20/3) = 3 v_2 / 10$. $f_{9c} = 9 v_1 / 40$. Set equal: $9v_1/40 = 3v_2/10 \implies 9v_1 = 12v_2 \implies v_1/v_2 = 12/9 = 4/3$. But we found $v_1/v_2 = 4$. There is an inconsistency. Let's assume the 'frequency of 9th harmonic' implies $f = (2 \times 9 - 1) \frac{v_1}{4 L_c} = 17 \frac{v_1}{4 L_c}$. And 4th harmonic of open pipe is $f = 4 \frac{v_2}{2 L_o} = 2 \frac{v_2}{L_o}$. Equating: $17 \frac{v_1}{4 L_c} = 2 \frac{v_2}{L_o}$. $L_o = \frac{8 L_c}{17} \frac{v_2}{v_1} = \frac{8 \times 10}{17} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{20}{17}$ cm. Still doesn't match. Final check: Maybe 4th harmonic of OPEN is $(2 \times 4) \frac{v_2}{..}$? No. What if bulk moduli are different $B_1, B_2$ and densities $\rho_1, \rho_2$? No, says same B. Let's assume my ratio calc is correct: $L_o = 20/9$ cm. Maybe option (d) is typo and should be 20/9? Closest option is $20/3 \approx 6.67$. $20/9 \approx 2.22$. $20/17 \approx 1.17$. None are close to $20/3$. Rechecking Q36 answer: it is (4), which is $20/3$ cm. My derivation $L_o = 20/9$ seems robust based on standard harmonic definitions. Let's try assuming 9th harmonic of closed means frequency = $9 \times f_{fundamental}$. $f = 9(v_1/4L_c)$. 4th harmonic of open means frequency = $4 \times f_{fundamental}$. $f=4(v_2/2L_o)$. $9v_1/(4L_c) = 4v_2/(2L_o) \implies L_o = \frac{8L_c}{9} \frac{v_2}{v_1} = \frac{8(10)}{9}\frac{1}{4} = \frac{20}{9}$. Let's assume density ratio $\rho_2:\rho_1=1:16$. $v_1/v_2=\sqrt{1/16}=1/4$. $L_o=\frac{8L_c}{9}\frac{v_2}{v_1}=\frac{80}{9}(4)=\frac{320}{9}$. Let's assume $\rho_1:\rho_2=16:1$. $v_1/v_2=\sqrt{1/16}=1/4$. $L_o=\frac{80}{9}\frac{1}{4} = 20/9$. Could closed pipe length be $L_c = 30$cm? $L_o = \frac{8(30)}{9}\frac{1}{4} = \frac{240}{36} = 20/3$. Yes, if $L_c=30$cm (not 10cm), then $L_o=20/3$cm. Let's assume $L_c=10$cm is correct, maybe density ratio is $1:4$? $v_1/v_2=2$. $L_o=\frac{80}{9}\frac{1}{2}=40/9$. Density ratio $4:1$? $v_1/v_2=1/2$. $L_o=\frac{80}{9}(2)=160/9$. It seems there's a likely typo in the question's numbers (e.g. $L_c=30$cm instead of 10cm) to get option (d).",

    "explanation": "Treat as 3 lenses in contact: water lens 1, glass lens, water lens 2. Water lens 1 (top): Top surface flat ($\infty$), bottom surface R1. Medium water $\mu_w=4/3$, surrounding assumed air? No, it's a system. Use relative refractive indices. $P_{total} = P_{water1} + P_{glass} + P_{water2}$. $P_{water1}$: Lens shape upper flat, lower R1. Material water (4/3). $P_{glass}$: Upper R1, lower R2. Material glass (3/2) relative to water (4/3). $\mu_{rel} = \mu_g/\mu_w = (3/2)/(4/3) = 9/8$. $P_{glass} = (\mu_{rel}-1)(\frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2}) = (\frac{9}{8}-1)(\frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2}) = \frac{1}{8}(\frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2})$. $P_{water2}$: Upper R2, lower flat. Material water (4/3). This approach is complex. Alternative: Lens surfaces power $P=P_1+P_2+P_3$. Surface 1 (flat water): Power=0. Surface 2 (water-glass interface R1): $P_2 = (\mu_g - \mu_w)/R_1 = (3/2 - 4/3)/R_1 = (9/6-8/6)/R_1 = \frac{1}{6R_1}$. Surface 3 (glass-water interface R2): $P_3 = (\mu_w - \mu_g)/R_2 = (4/3 - 3/2)/R_2 = (8/6-9/6)/R_2 = -\frac{1}{6R_2}$. Surface 4 (flat water): Power=0. Total power $P = P_1+P_2+P_3+P_4 = 0 + \frac{1}{6R_1} - \frac{1}{6R_2} + 0 = \frac{1}{6}(\frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2})$. This matches option (a). Let's re-check sign convention and answer key. Q42 -> (4). Option (d) is $-\frac{1}{6}(\frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2})$. This suggests my surface power calculation might have a sign error or R convention issue. If R1 is convex, R2 is concave for a typical biconvex shape, R1>0, R2<0. Power = $\frac{1}{6}(\frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{-|R_2|}) = \frac{1}{6}(\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{|R_2|})$. If R1 is convex, R2 is convex: $P=\frac{1}{6}(\frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2})$. If the result is (d), maybe $\mu_{water}>\mu_{glass}$? No. Let's revisit the definition of $P_i = (\mu_{after}-\mu_{before})/R$. P2: Before water, after glass. $P_2=(\mu_g-\mu_w)/R_1$. P3: Before glass, after water. $P_3=(\mu_w-\mu_g)/R_2$. Total $P=P_2+P_3 = \frac{\mu_g-\mu_w}{R_1} + \frac{\mu_w-\mu_g}{R_2} = (\mu_g-\mu_w)(\frac{1}{R_1}-\frac{1}{R_2}) = (3/2-4/3)(\frac{1}{R_1}-\frac{1}{R_2}) = \frac{1}{6}(\frac{1}{R_1}-\frac{1}{R_2})$. Still getting (a). The provided diagram seems to show a plano-concave water lens, a biconvex glass lens, and a plano-concave water lens. Let's assume R1 is radius of first glass surface, R2 radius of second. Top water lens power $P_{w1} = (\mu_w-1)(\frac{1}{\infty} - \frac{1}{R_1})$. Glass lens $P_g = (\mu_g-1)(\frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2})$. Bottom water lens $P_{w2} = (\mu_w-1)(\frac{1}{R_2} - \frac{1}{\infty})$. This assumes air surroundings, which is wrong. Using the surface method seems correct, result $\frac{1}{6}(\frac{1}{R_1}-\frac{1}{R_2})$. If the intended answer is (d), perhaps the question meant relative index $\mu_w/\mu_g$ or similar reversal. Assuming answer (d) is correct requires $P = (\mu_w-\mu_g)(\frac{1}{R_1}-\frac{1}{R_2}) = -\frac{1}{6}(\frac{1}{R_1}-\frac{1}{R_2})$.",

    "explanation": "Statement I: Correct. CH$_3$–O–CH$_2$–Cl is chloromethyl methyl ether. Although it's a primary halide, the adjacent oxygen atom can stabilize the carbocation formed during S$_N$1 via resonance (CH$_3$–O$^+$=CH$_2$ <-> CH$_3$–O–CH$_2^+$). This stabilization favors the S$_N$1 pathway. Statement II: Correct. Neopentyl chloride ((CH$_3$)$_3$C-CH$_2$-Cl) is a primary halide, but the bulky tertiary carbon atom adjacent to the primary carbon causes significant steric hindrance for the backside attack required in the S$_N$2 mechanism. Therefore, S$_N$2 reaction is very slow or does not occur easily.",

(i) Br2, AcOH doesn't react readily. If starts with Phenol: (i) Br2, AcOH -> monobromination, likely p-Bromophenol (and some o-). Let's assume starting material is Aniline (based on Sn/HCl step). (i) Br2, AcOH -> Tribromination (2,4,6-tribromoaniline). Step (ii) Sn/HCl is reduction (relevant for nitro group). Step (iii) NaNO2/HCl 273K is diazotization (for primary amine). Step (iv) C2H5OH + diazonium salt leads to reduction (deamination, removal of N2+) forming Benzene derivative, or ether formation. Let's re-examine Q63 image properly. The reactant IS shown: Nitrobenzene. (i) Br2, AcOH with nitrobenzene -> requires FeBr3 catalyst for bromination, usually gives m-bromonitrobenzene. Assuming Br2/AcOH works -> m-Bromonitrobenzene. (ii) Sn, HCl -> Reduction of NO2 to NH2 -> m-Bromoaniline. (iii) NaNO2, HCl, 273K -> Diazotization -> m-Bromobenzenediazonium chloride. (iv) C2H5OH -> Reduction of diazonium group -> Bromobenzene. If step (i) was Br2/FeBr3, the product is m-bromobenzene. Let's reconsider the reactant image, it looks like Aniline with OH? No, it looks like reactant is Phenol (image 1). Sequence on Phenol: (i) Br2, AcOH -> p-Bromophenol + o-Bromophenol. (ii) Sn, HCl -> No reaction? (iii) NaNO2/HCl -> No reaction? (iv) C2H5OH -> No reaction? This sequence seems mismatched for Phenol. Let's assume reactant is Aniline. (i) Br2, AcOH -> Tribromination -> 2,4,6-tribromoaniline. (ii) Sn/HCl -> No effect. (iii) NaNO2/HCl -> Diazotization -> diazonium salt. (iv) C2H5OH -> Reduction -> 1,3,5-Tribromobenzene. Look at options. (1) Phenol, (2) Ethoxybenzene, (3) p-Bromophenol + CH3CHO? No, (3) p-Bromophenol + p-Bromoethoxybenzene? The options shown in the image are complex structures, not just names. Option (1) looks like Phenol and Ethoxybenzene. Option (2) Ethoxybenzene. Option (3) p-Bromophenol and Acetaldehyde? Option (4) p-Bromophenol and p-Bromoethoxybenzene. The answer key says 63 -> (3). Let's assume the starting material leads to p-Bromophenol. Phenol -> (i) p-Bromophenol. If the sequence somehow produces acetaldehyde too... Maybe the structure in option 3 second part is wrong OCR. It seems to be CH3-CHO, maybe oxidation side reaction? Let's assume the primary product is p-Bromophenol. This implies starting with Phenol and step (i) giving p-Bromophenol. Steps ii, iii, iv might be irrelevant or act differently.

    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "The compound has two functional groups: carboxylic acid (-COOH) and ester (-COOCH3). Carboxylic acid has higher priority, so it determines the principal chain and suffix (-oic acid). Numbering starts from the -COOH carbon. Longest chain containing -COOH is 6 carbons (hexanoic acid). CH3-CH(COOH)-CH2-CH2-CH(COOCH3)-CH3. Numbering from right: 1-COOH, 2-CH(CH3), 3-CH2, 4-CH2, 5-CH(COOCH3), 6-CH3. Main chain is 6 carbons. Acid is at C1. Substituents: methyl at C2, and [methoxycarbonyl group + methyl group] at C5? No, the chain must be selected correctly. Let's identify the principal functional group: -COOH. The chain must include this carbon. Longest chain including C1(-COOH): HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH(COOCH3)-CH3. Chain length = 6. So, Hexanoic acid. Substituents: Methyl at C2. At C5, there is a methyl group and a methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH3) group. This numbering seems wrong based on image. Let's look at the image structure: Seems like C1(leftmost CH3)-C2(CH with COOCH3)-C3(CH2)-C4(CH2)-C5(CH with COOH)-C6(rightmost CH3). Prioritize COOH. Number from right: C1(CH3)-C2(CH with COOH)-C3(CH2)-C4(CH2)-C5(CH with COOCH3)-C6(CH3). Chain is 6 carbons long. It's a hexanoic acid derivative. -COOH is at C2. Substituents: Methyl at C2, Methoxycarbonyl at C5, Methyl at C5. Wait, the image has structure C1(HOOC)-C2(CH-CH3)-C3(CH2)-C4(CH2)-C5(CH-COOCH3)-C6(CH3). Principal chain is 6 carbons. Acid at C1. Name: ...hexanoic acid. Substituents: Methyl at C2. Methoxycarbonyl at C5. Methyl at C5. Wait, structure is C1(CH3)-C2(CH(COOH))-C3(CH2)-C4(CH2)-C5(CH(COOCH3))-C6(CH3)? Let's re-draw based on Q67 image more carefully. It's HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH(COOCH3)-CH3. Priority to COOH. C1 is COOH carbon. Numbering C1(COOH)-C2(CH-CH3)-C3(CH2)-C4(CH2)-C5(CH-COOCH3)-C6(CH3). This is a heptanoic acid derivative. C1=COOH. Substituents: 2-methyl, 5-methoxycarbonyl, 5-methyl. Name: 5-Methoxycarbonyl-2,5-dimethylheptanoic acid. This doesn't match options. Let's assume the structure given in the text representation is correct: CH3-CH(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-CH(COOH)-CH3. Priority COOH. Numbering: C1(CH3)-C2(CH(COOH))-C3(CH2)-C4(CH2)-C5(CH(COOCH3))-C6(CH3). It's a hexanoic acid. C1 is CH3, C2 has COOH. No, COOH must be C1 if possible. Let's number containing the COOH carbon in the main chain. HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH(COOCH3)-CH3. Main chain is 6 C atoms starting from COOH. 1(COOH), 2(CH-CH3), 3(CH2), 4(CH2), 5(CH-COOCH3), 6(CH3). It is 2-Methyl-5-methoxycarbonylhexanoic acid. Option (c) is 6-Methoxycarbonyl-2,5-dimethylhexanoic acid. This implies a 7 carbon chain? Rechecking the image drawing of Q67 structure carefully: Left end: COOH group. Right end: COOCH3 group. Chain: CH3-CH(group1)-CH2-CH2-CH(group2)-CH3. One group is COOH, other is COOCH3. Structure seems to be: CH3-CH(COOH)-CH2-CH2-CH(COOCH3)-CH3. Priority COOH. Chain numbered from left: 1(CH3)-2(CH-COOH)-3(CH2)-4(CH2)-5(CH-COOCH3)-6(CH3). Main chain is 6 carbons containing COOH at C2. Ester at C5. Substituents: methyl at C2, methoxycarbonyl at C5, methyl at C5. Hmm. Let's assume COOH is principal group. Chain containing it is 6 carbons. Number from the end closer to COOH: 1(CH3)-2(CH(COOCH3))-3(CH2)-4(CH2)-5(CH(COOH))-6(CH3). Name: ...hexanoic acid. Position 5. Substituents: methyl at 5, methoxycarbonyl at 2, methyl at 2. Name: 2-Methoxycarbonyl-2,5-dimethylhexanoic acid. Still not matching. Let's assume Ester is principal group (-oate suffix). Chain associated with O is methyl. Chain associated with C=O contains the COOH. Structure: CH3-CH(COOH)-CH2-CH2-CH(COOCH3)-CH3. Ester group COOCH3 at C5. Name: Methyl ...ester... Main chain containing C=O of ester: 5 carbons + C=O. CH3-CH(COOH)-CH2-CH2-CH-. Name: Methyl 5-carboxy-2-methylhexanoate. Matches option (d). Let's check priority rules again. COOH > Ester. So it MUST be an acid. Name must end in -oic acid. The only options ending in acid are (c). Option (c): 6-Methoxycarbonyl-2,5-dimethylhexanoic acid. Implies a 6 carbon acid chain, COOH is C1. Substituents at C2(methyl), C5(methyl), C6(methoxycarbonyl). Is the structure C1(COOH)-C2(CH-CH3)-C3(CH2)-C4(CH2)-C5(CH-CH3)-C6(COOCH3)? This structure fits name (c). Comparing with the image, it seems possible this is the intended structure (left COOH, right COOCH3).",

    "explanation": "Molar mass of AgCl = 108 + 35.5 = 143.5 g/mol. Mass of organic compound = 180 mg = 0.180 g. Mass of AgCl produced = 143.5 mg = 0.1435 g. Moles of AgCl = Mass / Molar mass = 0.1435 g / 143.5 g/mol = 0.001 mol. 1 mole of AgCl contains 1 mole of Cl. Moles of Cl in the sample = 0.001 mol. Mass of Cl = Moles * Molar mass = 0.001 mol * 35.5 g/mol = 0.0355 g = 35.5 mg. Percentage of Cl in the compound = (Mass of Cl / Mass of compound) * 100 = (35.5 mg / 180 mg) * 100 = (35.5 / 1.8) % \\approx 19.72%. Rounded to nearest integer if needed, but question seems to expect exact match. Let's recheck calculation. Mass Cl = 35.5mg. Mass compound = 180mg. %Cl = (35.5/180) * 100 = 3550 / 180 = 355 / 18 = 19.72... % Perhaps there's a typo in numbers. If AgCl was 143.5 mg from 177.5 mg compound? Or 143.5mg from 180mg -> 19.7%. Let's check answer key: 75 -> (20). This suggests the answer should be exactly 20%. Let's see if slight changes give 20%. If mass of compound was 177.5 mg: (35.5/177.5)*100 = 20%. It is likely the mass of the compound was intended to be 177.5 mg or the AgCl mass adjusted to give exactly 20%. Given the values, 19.72% is the calculated value. Assuming the answer is exactly 20%.",
