## Contribution Guidelines

When adding new AI-generated papers, please follow this **Utility-First Naming Convention**:

1.  **Title:** Use "[Subject] Practice" or "[Topic] Drill". Avoid titles like "ChatGPT Output" or including "(AI)".
2.  **Category:** Use the actual subject name (e.g., "Reasoning", "English").
3.  **Description:** Describe *what* the student will practice (e.g., "Focuses on blood relations and syllogisms").
